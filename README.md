one-armed bandit - a gambling machine that selects random configurations of various symbols. You win when you line up identical symbols in a row. You play for certain stakes that are converted into money. The higher the stake, the greater the multiplier or more lines scored.

This game is inspired by the game described above, the symbols have been replaced with colors, and you can win by drawing the same colors or three different ones. The game does not save your score after reloading the page or closing it.
